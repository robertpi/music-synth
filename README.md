# Sound Waves

Sound is a mechanical wave that is an oscillation of pressure transmitted through a solid, liquid, or gas, composed of frequencies within the range of hearing

Sound that is perceptible by humans has frequencies from about 20 Hz to 20,000 Hz

The below diagram shows a compression wave and chart measuring it's amplitude vs time.

## Notes

Notes are sounds at standard frequencies.

A440 is the musical note A above middle C, which has a frequency of 440 Hz and serves as a general tuning standard for musical pitch

An octave is the interval between one musical pitch and another with half or double its frequency.

If one note has a frequency of 440 Hz, the note an octave above it is at 880 Hz, and the note an octave below is at 220 Hz.

A semitone, also called a half step or a half tone, is the smallest musical interval commonly used in Western tonal music.

There eight notes in an octave, but 12 semitones.

Notes uneven distributed semitones aren’t.

| Note | Enharmonic | Semitones |
|------|------------|-----------|
| C	    |            | 0         |
| C♯   | D♭         | 1         |
| D    |            | 2         |
| E♭   | D♯         | 3         |
| E	    | F♭         | 4         |
| F    | E♯         | 5         |
| F♯   | G♭         | 6         |
| G    |            | 7         |
| G♯   | A♭         | 8         |
| A    |            | 9         |
| B♭	   | A♯         | 10        |
| B    |            | 11        |
| C    | B♯         | 12        |
